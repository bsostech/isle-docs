# Governance

The community DAO is in charge of managing governance. It has the ability to perform maintenance functions and parameter adjustments to the protocol via decentralized voting, including:

* Upgrading contracts
* Changing protocol configurations and parameters
* Pausing protocol activity in the event of an emergency

Anyone can participate in governance by making proposals, discussing them, and participating in Snapshot votes.

## Participation

### Governance Forum

This is a place where community members can make and discuss proposals.

## Governance Council

The governance council of Lopo has been set up to execute on-chain transactions on behalf of the results of community votes. The Lopo Council is a 3-of-5 multisig with 5 members representing all stakeholders participating in the protocol.

Members of the governance council will be released after the protocol launches officially.
